Collusion

Poor
Your Collusion scores indicate that harmful group behaviors—such as “People on my team regularly talk negatively about others” and “It’s common for team members to align with each other against someone”—are occurring frequently. This is damaging trust, creating factions, and making collaboration harder. At all three levels (peer-to-peer, with managers, and in cultural support), collusion appears unchallenged or even normalized.

Risks: Left unaddressed, high collusion will deepen divisions, increase turnover, and erode performance.

Recommendations:

    Peer-to-Peer: Train employees in real-time intervention language (“Let’s bring that concern directly to them”), and set norms for addressing issues directly.

    With Managers: Require managers to address all reported incidents promptly and facilitate repair conversations between parties.

    Culture: Make “No harmful group behavior” a visible cultural value, reinforce it in onboarding, and integrate examples into leadership training.

Mediocre
Collusion happens occasionally but not constantly, as shown in responses to “People on my team regularly talk negatively about others”. While most people avoid harmful group behavior, some situations still trigger it—and peers, managers, and the culture don’t always shut it down.

Risks: Occasional collusion can normalize over time, increasing frequency and severity.

Recommendations:

    Peer-to-Peer: Teach teams how to pivot negative talk toward constructive solutions.

    With Managers: Encourage managers to call out early-stage behaviors before they spread.

    Culture: Promote bridge-building stories in internal communications and add collusion-awareness checkpoints to team health reviews.

Terrific
Your Collusion scores are excellent—behaviors measured in “People on my team regularly talk negatively about others” are rare. Low collusion is unusual in most organizations, and it’s a sign of strong relational health.

Risks: Collusion can re-emerge during stress or change if vigilance drops.

Recommendations:

    Peer-to-Peer: Keep bridge-building visible with recognition programs and peer-led conflict resolution workshops.

    With Managers: Maintain manager awareness training to spot early warning signs.

    Culture: Celebrate low collusion scores in company-wide communications, reinforcing “We protect relationships” as part of your identity.

Trust

Poor
Low Trust scores across items like “I trust my colleagues to look out for my best interests” and “The culture emphasizes repairing trust when it’s damaged” mean people doubt whether others—peers, managers, or the culture—will act fairly, keep commitments, or safeguard relationships.

Risks: Low trust slows decision-making, increases conflict, and drives disengagement.

Recommendations:

    Peer-to-Peer: Train teams to address misunderstandings directly and build trust through shared wins.

    With Managers: Require visible follow-through on commitments and encourage vulnerability.

    Culture: Embed trust-repair training into leadership programs and make restoring trust an explicit performance expectation.

Mediocre
Trust is functional but fragile—responses to “There is a high level of trust among people on my team” vary. Trust exists most of the time, but hesitation appears under pressure.

Risks: Moderate trust can slide into distrust if left untended.

Recommendations:

    Peer-to-Peer: Create forums for openly sharing successes and challenges.

    With Managers: Demonstrate fairness and address patterns of perceived favoritism.

    Culture: Celebrate examples of trust maintenance or repair and keep transparency visible.

    With Managers: Model openness to feedback by responding calmly and appreciatively.

Mediocre
Receiving Feedback is inconsistent—some accept it well, others less so, as seen in varied responses to “Our team makes sure we are all well-trained in how to receive feedback.”

Risks: Mixed receptivity limits knowledge sharing and learning.

Recommendations:

    Peer-to-Peer: Encourage informal “practice feedback” exchanges.

    With Managers: Coach managers to give feedback in a supportive, non-punitive tone.

    Culture: Include feedback receptivity in performance reviews to reinforce its value.

Terrific
High scores in “I feel I am good at receiving feedback” indicate strong openness across the board.

    Peer-to-Peer: Encourage real-time feedback exchanges in low-stakes settings.

    With Managers: Recognize managers who deliver timely, balanced feedback.

    Culture: Incorporate feedback practice into ongoing training cycles.

    With Managers: Continue modeling balance between praise and constructive points.

    Culture: Highlight how feedback leads to tangible wins in performance.

Accountability

Risks: Missed commitments damage trust and delay results.

Recommendations:

    Peer-to-Peer: Use shared tracking tools for commitments.

    With Managers: Enforce clear deadlines and consequences.

    Culture: Make follow-through a non-negotiable cultural value.

Mediocre

Recommendations:

    Peer-to-Peer: Pair up for mutual accountability on shared goals.

    With Managers: Use regular progress check-ins to surface delays early.

    With Managers: Model curiosity and ask for multiple viewpoints.

    Culture: Provide cultural competence and empathy training.

    With Managers: Continue modeling empathy in all communications.

    With Managers: Make relationship health a standing agenda item.

    Culture: Include relationship-building in performance measures.
