    "engagement_summary": "In October of 2025, Company A engaged The Transformation Guild to perform an assessment of the strength and vulnerabilities of the Green Meadows Complex, a key distribution facility for the Southeast region.\n\nInteracting closely with Company contact Lynn Flavors, Transformations Guild consultants interviewed key Subject Matter Experts. Using this information, The Guild constructed a custom survey instrument designed to surface key insights into the culture of the Green Meadows Complex.",
    "results_summary": "Consultants from The Transformation Guild uncovered:\nLong-held resentments between two teams who worked consecutive shifts, which was resulting in problematic collusive behaviors, at times rising to the level of outright sabotage\n“Factions” that had formed in support of one or the other of these teams\nResentment towards a manager, since departed, who was viewed as spearheading the collusive behavior\nTeams who were fatigued by the conflicts and eager to find a way forward, frequently referring to the work environment “toxic” and “exhausting”\nIndividuals who felt that some of the perpetrators of “all the unpleasantness” were still present and not been held accountable for their actions. Trust that the leadership teams will make a positive difference are exceedingly low.",
    "suggested_actions": "Use the data obtained from the survey to recognize the severity of the issues in the culture of the Green Meadows Complex, and allocate remedial resources accordingly\nConvene a leadership conversation to share responsibility for the culture of the Green Meadows Complex, and determine a path forward together\nIntroduce a relationship-smart culture, emphasizing accountability and feedback skills, that will help team members at the individual contributor and supervisor levels make a positive difference in the organization’s culture"

    "metrics_quarterly": "Trust & Relationship Focus (% positive): trend by function and job level\n-\tCollusion indicators: decrease in destructive teasing and being forced to choose a side; increase in direct-conversation resolutions.\n-\tImprovement of accountability skills at the leadership level",
    "closing_thoughts": "We’re seeing clear strengths to amplify and a focused set of habits to tighten. With visible ownership, simple rituals, and steady measurement, momentum typically shows up inside the first quarter. Maintain a 30-day inspect-and-adapt loop and a quarterly read-out on the metrics above to keep progress durable."
